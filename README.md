# Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  An explicit understanding of user needs is imperative before implementation. This can be done by collecting and analyzing collected data and through the development of well-developed and detailed user stories followed by direct feedback from the client and/or the Product Owner of your interpretation based on your analysis and user stories. This will provide an opportunity to confirm that your interpretation of all of the client’s needs is clearly understood and can be well executed before wasting time and resources. 
 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  My approach  and the agile methodology that I would use for developing programs is the Scrum Agile methodology as it closely aligns with my beliefs on how programs should be developed and structured. I believe the approach should be a team/collective approach versus a leader/boss-to-team. This will reduce push-back and improve team collaboration. To effectively implement new programs there needs to be open and clear communication, empathy, flexibility, and the drive to work together as one united front to produce great projects. All of which are principles of the Scrum Agile methodology. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be considered a good team member on a software development team means you have the ability to clearly and effectively communicate both verbally and written with all members, take ownership and responsibility for one’s self and tasks assigned, demonstrate reliability and flexibility, and possess a team-player attitude.
